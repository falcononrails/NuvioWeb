// that is already showing is touched here — nothing about ordering, artwork,
// or which items appear is decided by this module, so it can never guess a
// wrong Next-Up episode or misorder the row. The full refresh still runs
// afterward to reconcile everything else.

// One title reaches this from two directions that spell it differently. A film
// arrives from a provider carrying its own title id as the video id and zeros
// for season and episode, while the same film written by playback here leaves
// all three empty. Compared literally they never matched, so the fast path
// silently never ran for a film and its card only moved once the whole row had
// been rebuilt over the network -- seconds, for a number already in hand.
